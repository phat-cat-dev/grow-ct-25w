/**
 * phase-confirm.js
 *
 * RJ-0061 (adp-0216): lands one phase's soft and advisory gates in a
 * single run, from a draft of answers written by a `/phase-draft`
 * session (one draft file, GDP-1, covering the whole phase). This tool
 * holds the mechanical work only; it never proposes content itself and
 * never touches `config.json` or `en/*.json` (DR-1's content-authoring
 * step in `land.md` is unaffected and still runs per gate).
 *
 * Which gates a phase batches: every gate in the named phase whose
 * `hardness` (design-kb/design-kb.gates.json, read through
 * tools/gate-order.js, RJ-0059) is `soft` or `advisory`, never a
 * hardcoded list. Hard-stop gates in the same phase (e.g. crs-01_course-facets,
 * crs-03_vocabulary in Phase A) are answered one at a time via the existing
 * `/gate` and `/land` path and are not part of this batch.
 *
 * Per-gate outcome (RULINGS 5, adp-0216-outcomes-draft-reopen.md,
 * verbatim): "human-amended where Abbott marks a gate, the gate's
 * default provenance where he does not." Two branches only:
 *   - marked: provenance "human-amended"; the draft's own proposed
 *     value is carried as `originalProposal` (the schema requires it
 *     exactly here, confirmed directly in tools/validate-design-
 *     schemas.py's comment at the course-design-schema conditional).
 *   - not marked (stood on silence): the gate's own hardness/
 *     defaultType decides the word, the same mapping `land.md` step 2
 *     already uses per gate: hardness advisory -> "advisory-stated";
 *     defaultType fixed-value -> "ai-default-stood"; defaultType
 *     ai-proposal-stands -> "ai-proposal-stood". Any other defaultType
 *     on a soft gate is refused by name, not guessed.
 *
 * confirmedAt (schemas/course-design.schema.json, the records item
 * shape): enum ["gate", "phase-close"], described there as
 * distinguishing "confirmed-at-gate from bulk-blessing at phase
 * close." This tool stamps `confirmedAt: "phase-close"` on exactly the
 * not-marked branch above (the records that stood on silence in this
 * batch), per RULINGS 5's own words ("stamps confirmedAt on every
 * record that stood on silence"); marked (human-amended) records carry
 * no confirmedAt.
 *
 * FLAGGED TENSION, not resolved here (adp-0216, RJ-0061): schemas/
 * common.schema.json's own provenance-enum description reads
 * "human-confirmed at phase close is distinguished via confirmedAt" --
 * tying confirmedAt to the human-confirmed word specifically. RULINGS
 * 5's two-branch model (above) never produces human-confirmed at all,
 * so confirmedAt as implemented here stamps ai-default-stood,
 * ai-proposal-stood or advisory-stated records, not human-confirmed
 * ones. Built to RULINGS 5's own explicit words, which is this job's
 * direct and most specific instruction; the tension against the
 * common.schema.json description is named here, in the command doc
 * and in the session's report rather than silently resolved either
 * way.
 *
 * bulkBlessing (schemas/course-design.schema.json's `phases[]` item
 * shape) carries three buckets: `blessed`, `stood`, `proposalStood`.
 * This tool populates only `stood` (ai-default-stood gates) and
 * `proposalStood` (ai-proposal-stood gates); it never populates
 * `blessed`, since RULINGS 5's two-branch model has no path that
 * produces human-confirmed. advisory-stated and human-amended gate
 * ids are not listed in any bulkBlessing bucket; they are still
 * present as records on their own gates.
 *
 * Amend rate: logged by the calling session into the course's own
 * `docs/project/design-phase-logs/<slug>.md`, as a dated line, not
 * written by this tool. This tool prints the rate (`marked`/`total`,
 * which gate ids were marked) so the session has it to log without
 * recounting.
 *
 * Validate before read-back (RJ-0102, adp-0226, D-0081 (a)): after the
 * write, and before the read-back below, this tool runs the course-
 * design schema validator (tools/validate-design-schemas.py
 * --course-design) on the record it just wrote. A record the
 * validator refuses stops here: the validator's own named errors are
 * printed and the read-back is skipped. The write itself still
 * stands -- report-failed-state, not rollback, since the manifest is
 * append-only by the tool's own design (see applyPhaseBatch's
 * comment); unwinding a just-appended record would fight that
 * invariant rather than honour it, and a caller who re-runs validate-
 * design-schemas.py directly against the path this tool printed sees
 * the same failure, not a file that silently reverted. This replaces
 * the choice RJ-0080 made below (validator skipped entirely); see
 * runCourseDesignValidator's own comment for the CLI contract this
 * relies on.
 *
 * Read-back (RJ-0080, adp-0223): after a write the validator accepts,
 * this tool renders the course design specification (tools/render-
 * course-spec.js) from the just-written record and writes it beside
 * the record itself, never changing the record a second time. See
 * renderReadBack's own comment for what this does and does not run.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node tools/phase-confirm.js --course-design=<path> --draft=<path> --phase=<id> [--store=<path>] [--gate-profiles=<path>]
 *
 * Draft file shape (written by the /phase-draft session, GDP-1):
 *   { "answers": [
 *       { "gateId": "gates/B1", "decidedValue": {...}, "marked": false },
 *       { "gateId": "gates/B2", "decidedValue": {...}, "marked": true,
 *         "originalProposal": {...} }

 * test 3: "a run reaching no gates fails").
 *
 * `gateProfilesStore`/`activeProfile` (D9/D-adp3 profile wiring, 4 Nov
 * 2026): when a gateProfilesStore is supplied, the phase's gate list is
 * further filtered through gateOrder.profileGateIds, mirroring reopen.js's
 * own D8(a) filter (RJ-0062) field-for-field. Without this, a CRS
 * phase-close on any built-course-shape course demands answers for
 * crs-06_pathway-statements and crs-08_progression too (both soft/advisory,
 * both profiles: ["pathway-distillation"] only, neither applicable under
 * built-course-shape) - buildPhaseBatch would then throw "no answer
 * supplied" for gates this profile never asks. activeProfile defaults to
 * 'built-course-shape' when the manifest carries no `profile` field,
 * matching every other profile resolution in this codebase (reopen.js,
 * validate-design-schemas.py's NSK-1). Omitting gateProfilesStore (as
 * every call before this fix did) skips the filter entirely - the
 * pre-existing, unfiltered behaviour - matching profileGateIds' own "null
 * means can't resolve, fall back to universal" contract. The
 * gates.length === 0 throw below still fires, now checked AFTER the
 * profile filter, so a phase that genuinely has nothing to batch under
 * the active profile is refused by the same named error as a phase with
 * no soft/advisory gate at all.
