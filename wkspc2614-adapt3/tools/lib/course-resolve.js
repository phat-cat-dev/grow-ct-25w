/**
 * course-resolve.js
 *
 * Shared course-path resolver for manifest-completeness.js, session-audit.js,
 * conformance-lint.js, verify-course.js, merge-health.js, verify-all-courses.js
 * and voice-lint.js. Single source of truth for "where does a course slug's
 * directory live", replacing independent (and mostly broken) hardcodes of
 * `courses/<slug>`.
 * See docs/project/pipeline-stocktake-2026-09/pipeline-requirements-register.md,
 * PR-1-11, established 16 Sep 2026 by live run.
 *
 * PROBLEM 1 - which root: since the archive move at b152c3a (17 Sep 2026),
 * `courses/<slug>` no longer exists for any of the four original courses;
 * live content is under `courses/_generated/<full-context-slug>/`. A caller
 * must say which root(s) it means to search - there is no ambient default
 * here, deliberately: a shell-only check silently reading generated output
 * would be a worse failure than the current, visible one.
 *
 * PROBLEM 2 - the course-design filename: inside every one of the 21
 * directories under `courses/_generated/`, the course-design file is named
 * for the BASE TIER, not the full context slug of the directory it lives in
 * (e.g. `course-design_academic-writing-advanced.json` inside
 * `academic-writing-advanced-banking-and-finance/`). Confirmed across all 21,
 * recounted, 16 Sep 2026. Constructing the filename by templating the slug
 * (what every tool did before this fix) fails inside all of them. This
 * resolver globs the resolved directory for `course-design_*.json` instead
 * of assuming its name, and REPORTS via `warnings` rather than silently
 * picking when it finds zero or more than one match - the whole reason this
 * file exists is that an unexamined naming assumption already produced
 * broken tools once.
 *
 * Named roots and what each means:
 *   'courses'                 -> <repo>/courses/<slug>, or (pathway/shell
 *                                reorg, 10 Nov 2026) <repo>/courses/
 *                                <pathway>/shell/generic/<slug>, where
 *                                <pathway> is <slug> with its trailing tier
 *                                stripped - the location every pathway now
 *                                uses. Tried in that order, first match
 *                                wins; a caller still says just 'courses'
 *                                and does not need to know the pathway.
 *   'courses/_generated'      -> <repo>/courses/_generated/<slug>
 *
 * No archive root. RBD-1 AMENDMENT: no tool reads from the archive; there is
 * no opt-in path here for a caller to pass by mistake or on purpose.
 *
 * roots is REQUIRED and has no default - every call site must say
 * explicitly which root(s) it means (Abbott's ruling: "No ambient default
 * a caller can forget to think about. A shell check silently reading
 * generated output would be worse than the current failure.").
